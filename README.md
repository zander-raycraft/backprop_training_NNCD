This project explores teaching a custom neural network to recognize patterns in binary addition. The model is architected from the ground up, relying only on NumPy for mathematical calculations and dericving the backpropagation training algorithm. A data generation script enables easy scaling, allowing you to adjust dataset size and network architecture to experiment with different configurations to see the models ability to generalize the data patterns on novelty inputs.
